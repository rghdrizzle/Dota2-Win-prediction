# Dota2-Win-prediction

The whole project is to predict the outcome of a Dota 2 game given all the game’s characteristics up to a certain point in the game. There are two teams in Dota 2 games: Radiant and Dire. You’ll need to evaluate the chances team Radiant victory. Game’s data is presented with numeric and categorical features, event logs, time series, etc. Working with game’s data and learning to see patterns and regularities can prove very useful in further work.
In a regular Dota 2 game each of two teams - Radiant and Dire - consists of 5 players. For each game player chooses a hero and consequently a role. Dota 2 is a team game so the team’s composition matters. The map contains bases of each team (fountain) and 3 lanes on each side, shops, Roshan's lair and other elements
